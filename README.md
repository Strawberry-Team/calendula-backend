# ðŸŒ¼ Calendula API

## Short Description


## Screenshots of Solution


## Requirements and Dependencies
- **Node.JS** >= v22
- **NPM** >= v10
- **MySQL** >= 8.0

Before starting, ensure the required technologies are installed.

## Database Setup
The database schema is provided in the `db/db.sql` file. Run the SQL commands in your MySQL database to set up the required tables.

## Docker
```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.development up -d
```

## How to Run the Solution
1. Clone this repository and move to the project directory.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install the dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure the database connection by updating the `.env` file with your MySQL database credentials. Example:
   ```
   DATABASE_HOST=localhost
   DATABASE_PORT=3306
   DATABASE_USER=root
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=root
   ```
3.1. For developers, you need to create `.env.development` and `.env.test` based on the `.env.*.example` files
4. Log in to your MySQL. 
5. Copy the contents of the [db/schema.sql](db/schema.sql) file and execute it in MySQL. You can also execute the SQL query through the MySQL CLI. To do this, run the command `mysql -u {USER_NAME} -p < db/db.sql`. You need to provide your MySQL login and password.
6. Apply similar steps as in **step 5**, but use the data file [db/data.sql](db/data.sql).
7. Start the server.
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   
## Mailing Service
[Ethereal](https://ethereal.email/) is a fake SMTP service, mostly aimed at Nodemailer and EmailEngine users (but not limited to). It's a completely free anti-transactional email service where messages never get delivered.
To view the letter that the user will receive, you need to log in to this service using a test login and password.

```text
login: ricky43@ethereal.email
password: 4e1zbM2nxsMu2d823E
```

## REST API documentation
The documentation of all available endpoints can be found [http://localhost:8080/api-docs/](http://localhost:8080/api-docs/). The [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) library is used.

## Database Migration

Migrations are possible on such environments: dev, test, and prod. Environment settings are loaded from a `./db/migration_config.json` file.
Create your `./db/migration_config.json` file and add the properties for the environments to it. To do this, copy `./db/migration_config.json.example` or to `./db/migration_config.json`. Then edit `./db/migration_config.json` if necessary (e.g. add a test database).

Note that migrations are only possible on **existing databases**. Therefore, create your database first. Example of a database creation query to be executed in the database console:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE Calendula_Test;
USE Calendula_Test;
```
In the examples of all commands below in the text `<env>` is the name of the environment to perform the migration, e.g. `dev`, `test` or `prod`.

The `create` command creates a migration that loads sql file with the name <migration-name> in configured migrations directory `./db/migrations`.
```bash
npm run migrate:create:<env> -- <migration-name>
```
Where `<migration-name>` is the name of the migration you are creating, e.g., `update-events-categories`.

The `up` command executes the migrations of your currently configured migrations directory. More specific the up migrations are being called.
```bash
npm run migrate:up:<env>
```
The `down` command executes the migrations of your currently configured migrations directory. More specific the down migrations are being called.
```bash
npm run migrate:down:<env>
```
The reset command is a shortcut to execute all down migrations and literally reset all migrations which where currently done. The reset command also executes by default only the first scope.
```bash
npm run migrate:reset:<env>
```
Answers to other questions can be found in the official [db-migrate](https://db-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation.

## API Testing
Create an `.env.test` file and add the variables for the test environment to it. To do this, copy `.env.test.example` or to `.env.test`. Then edit `.env.test` if necessary (e.g. add a test database).

Start the server with the command:
```bash
npm run start:test
```
Once the dependencies are installed and the backend is running, you can run the tests. To do this, use the command:
Running all tests:
```bash
npm run test
```
Run all tests and create a report on the results:
```bash
npm run test:report
```
Run tests for a specific component:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/api/<file_name>.test.js --project=chromium --debug
```
